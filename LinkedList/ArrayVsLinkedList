Both Array and LinkedList can be used to store linear data of similar types, but they both have some advantages and disadvantages
over each other.

Key difference between array and linked list is as follow

1. An array is the ds that contain a collection of similar type data elements whereas the linked list is considered as
   non-primitive data structure contain a collection of unordered linked elements known as nodes.

2. In the array the element belongs to the index, i.e., if you want to get into the fourth element you have
   to write the variable name with its index or location within the square bracket.

3. In a linked list though you have to start from the head and work your way until you get the fourth element.

4. Accessing an element in an array is fast, while linked list takes linear time, so it is quite a bit slower.

5. Operation like insertion and deletion in array consume a lot of time. On the other hand, performance of
   these operation in linked list is fast.

6. Arrays are of fixed size, In contrast linked list are dynamic and flexible.

7. In an array memory is assigned during compile time while in Linked List it is allocated during
   execution or runtime.

8. Elements are stored consecutively in arrays whereas it is stored randomly in Linked lists.

9. The requirement of memory is less due to actual data being stored within the index in the array.
   As against, there is a need for more memory in Linked Lists due to storage of additional
   next and previous referencing elements.

10. In addition memory utilization is inefficient in the array. Conversely,
    memory utilization is efficient in the linked list.
