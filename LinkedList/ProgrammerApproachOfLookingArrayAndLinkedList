So array elements are contiguous in memory and therefore not requiring any metadata. And linked list
 nodes are non-contiguous in memory thereby requiring metadata in the form of location of the next node.
 Apart from this difference, we can see that the array could have several unused elements because memory
  has already been allocated. But the linked list will have only the required no. of data items.
