1. Preorder Traversal
In a N-ary tree, preorder means visit the root node first and then traverse the subtree rooted at its children one by one. For instance, the preorder of the 3-ary tree above is: A->B->C->E->F->D->G.

2. Postorder Traversal
In a N-ary tree, postorder means traverse the subtree rooted at its children first and then visit the root node itself. For instance, the postorder of the 3-ary tree above is: B->E->F->C->G->D->A.

3. Level-order Traversal
Level-order traversal in a N-ary tree is the same with a binary tree. Typically, when we do breadth-first search in a tree, we will traverse the tree in level order. For instance, the level-order of the 3-ary tree above is: A->B->C->D->E->F->G.
